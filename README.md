# Hollowverse Design

This repo is the source of truth of Hollowverse.com UI and UX. 
It communicates through HTML, CSS, and JS.

However, the code in this repo is not the main concern. The main concern is the final output 
on the browser.

## How to use this repo

* Clone it, and `cd` into it
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

At this point you'll have a web server running on your local machine at a certain port. You
should see a message on your terminal telling you how to reach that web server from your 
browser. 

For example, the server might be reachable at the following URL `http://localhost:5000`. Open that page.

On the main page, you'll see links. These links lead to full designs of mock pages.
